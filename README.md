# SensorHub

REST API for IoT environmental monitoring. Sensors send temperature, humidity and CO2 readings which are stored in MongoDB and aggregated into hourly CSV reports uploaded to MinIO.

## Stack

- **FastAPI** — Python 3.12
- **MongoDB** — readings storage
- **MinIO** — report storage (S3-compatible)

## Quickstart

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in credentials
docker compose up -d
```

API available at `http://localhost:8001` · MinIO console at `http://localhost:9001`
